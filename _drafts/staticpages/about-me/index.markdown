# Hi! My name is Iain Dunning




I'm a PhD student in the [Operations Research Center](http://web.mit.edu/orc/www/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I started here in September 2011.




In the summer of 2013 I worked at [Google San Francisco](http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/working-at-google-san-francisco.html) in the area of search.




 Before coming to America I studied [Engineering Science](http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) at the [University of Auckland](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I was there from early 2007 to late 2010.




I'm interested in **problem solving** - whether its problems that you can **solve with mathematics** (modelling, optimization, probability, ...), **making things** (programming, hacks (the MIT kind), ....), **working with people** (entrepreneurship, volunteering, ...), or everything all together!




If you'd like to know more about where I've worked and studied, checked out my [profile on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/iaindunning).




If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at [idunning AT mit DOT edu](mailto://idunningATmitDOTedu).




(you can also judge my music taste/recommend me something to listen to at [my Last.fm page](http://www.last.fm/user/iain_nz)!)
