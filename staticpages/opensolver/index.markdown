**OpenSolver** is an add-in for Microsoft Excel that allows users to harness the power of the [COIN-OR CBC solver](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) while still having the convenience of Excel and the built-in [Solver add-in](http://www.solver.com/). By using CBC, OpenSolver removes all the artificial limitations on problem size forced by Solver, and because its all open-source ("free as in beer" _and_ "free as in speech") it allows for large and complicated problems to be shared and solved by people outside the OR community who may not have access to commercial solvers. OpenSolver has been developed by [Dr Andrew Mason](http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/andrew-mason/) (University of Auckland) and myself. OpenSolver is being used to solve business problems around the world, as well as an educational tool for teaching students about optimization.
