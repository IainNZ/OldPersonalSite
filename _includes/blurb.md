Hi! My name is Iain Dunning. I’m currently a PhD student in the [Operations Research Center](http://web.mit.edu/orc/www/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I started here in September 2011.
  
I’m interested in problem solving of all kinds - especially using my programming and mathematics skills.

In the summer of 2013 I worked at [Google San Francisco](http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/working-at-google-san-francisco.html) as a quantitative analyst intern on the search team.

Before coming to America I studied [Engineering Science](http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) at the [University of Auckland](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I was there from early 2007 to late 2010.
