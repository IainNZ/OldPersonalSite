Hi! My name is Iain Dunning. Iâ€™m currently a PhD student in the [Operations Research Center](http://web.mit.edu/orc/www/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I started here in September 2011. My research work is primarily on robust optimization, including tools for modelling problems and new algorithms for solving them (with [Dimitris Bertsimas](http://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/)).

* I like programming, and host all my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/IainNZ/). 
* I'm fairly active in the [Julia](http://julialang.org) community. A lot of my work is related to optimization software - you can find out more about this at [JuliaOpt](http://juliaopt.org).
* I have one academic paper in the publishing pipeline right now, ["Computing in Operations Research using Julia"](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2013/05/3883.html).

### Resume in Brief

In the summer of 2013 I worked at [Google San Francisco](http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/working-at-google-san-francisco.html) as a quantitative analyst intern on the search team. I proposed a new algorithm for use in the crawler and then validated it by performing "big data" analyses using MapReduce.

I'm from New Zealand. I got my *Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)* in [Engineering Science](http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) at the [University of Auckland](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I was there from early 2007 to late 2010.
