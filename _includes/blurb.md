Hi! My name is Iain Dunning. Iâ€™m currently a PhD candidate in the [Operations Research Center](http://web.mit.edu/orc/www/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I started here in September 2011. My research work is primarily on robust optimization, including tools for modeling problems and new algorithms for solving them (with [Dimitris Bertsimas](http://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/)).

* I like programming, and host some of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/IainNZ/). Most of my work lately is in [Julia](http://julialang.org), but I've used a lot of C++ and Python for both work and play. I've also done a fair bit of dabbling in Javascript, and know a dangerous amount of VBA (<small><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QefqJ7YhbWQ#t=116">"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe..."</a></small>).
* Speaking of Julia, I'm fairly active in the community. A lot of my work is related to optimization software - you can find out more about this at [JuliaOpt](http://juliaopt.org), and see the more of my code on the [GitHub page](http://github.com/JuliaOpt). My biggest project is [JuMP](https://github.com/JuMP.jl), an algebraic modeling language/domain-specific language for optimization problems. I've done some [talks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1utTuR1ExpIffr4oi4gEniEkNtPkJAfOz7RqH2pcx4h0/edit?usp=sharing) on [this](http://www.mit.edu/~mlubin/informs2013.pdf).
* I have also been tackling the problem of Julia package ecosystem quality by [running extensive tests daily](https://github.com/IainNZ/PackageEvaluator.jl/) and [sharing the results](http://iainnz.github.io/packages.julialang.org/).
* I have a paper in the academic publishing pipeline right now, ["Computing in Operations Research using Julia"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1431).

### Resume in Brief

In the summer of 2013 I worked at [Google San Francisco](http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/working-at-google-san-francisco.html) as a "quantitative analyst" intern on the search team. I proposed a new bandit-inspired heuristic for use in the crawler and then validated it by writing a lot of code to analyze the impacts using MapReduce (via C++) - big data, big fun!

I'm from New Zealand. I got my *Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)* in [Engineering Science](http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) at the [University of Auckland](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/) in Auckland, New Zealand. I was there from early 2007 to late 2010.
