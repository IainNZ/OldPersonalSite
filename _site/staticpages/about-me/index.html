<h1>Hi! My name is Iain Dunning</h1>

<p>I&#39;m a PhD student in the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/orc/www/">Operations Research Center</a> at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I started here in September 2011.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2013 I worked at <a href="http://www.google.com/about/jobs/lifeatgoogle/working-at-google-san-francisco.html">Google San Francisco</a> in the area of search.</p>

<p> Before coming to America I studied <a href="http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/">Engineering Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/">University of Auckland</a> in Auckland, New Zealand. I was there from early 2007 to late 2010.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in <strong>problem solving</strong> - whether its problems that you can <strong>solve with mathematics</strong> (modelling, optimization, probability, ...), <strong>making things</strong> (programming, hacks (the MIT kind), ....), <strong>working with people</strong> (entrepreneurship, volunteering, ...), or everything all together!</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to know more about where I&#39;ve worked and studied, checked out my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/iaindunning">profile on LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at <a href="mailto://idunningATmitDOTedu">idunning AT mit DOT edu</a>.</p>
