<p><strong>SimplexJS</strong> is a Javascript library that solves <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">linear programming problems</a> (LPs) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns">mixed-integer linear programming problems</a> (MILPs) right in your browser. I&#39;m not sure if this is particularily useful for any industrial application, but was fun to make, and could be used for teaching. It solves linear programs using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">Simplex</a> method, and uses branch-and-bound to solve problems with integer variables.</p>

<p>The Simplex implementation is correct as far as I can tell, but the branch-and-bound solver might not be, and is certainly not very efficient. LPs must be provided as dense matrices and vectors, in the following form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">min c.x
st   Ax == b
 l &lt;= x &lt;= u
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Demonstration - solving the Travelling Salesperson Problem in your browser</h3>

<p>To demonstrate that the code does indeed work, I made an <a href="?page_id=39">interactive demo</a> that lets you construct instances of the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and solve them using the sub-tour elimination (cutting plane) method. You can find it here (probably will want a browser made in the past couple of years to make sure it works!)</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>I haven&#39;t worked on it much since I initially made it, but I hope to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check the implementation of the simplex method.</p></li>
<li><p>Add some modelling tools - making the A matrix by hand is very painful and is hindering the practicality of this code!</p></li>
<li><p>Accept problems in a more general form and transform them to the above form.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the branch-and-bound code less stupid. It was made in a very short amount of time!</p></li>
<li><p>Make more examples.</p></li>
</ul>
