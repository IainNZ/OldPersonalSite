<p><strong>OpenSolver</strong> is an add-in for Microsoft Excel that allows users to harness the power of the <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc">COIN-OR CBC solver</a> while still having the convenience of Excel and the built-in <a href="http://www.solver.com/">Solver add-in</a>. By using CBC, OpenSolver removes all the artificial limitations on problem size forced by Solver, and because its all open-source (&quot;free as in beer&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;free as in speech&quot;) it allows for large and complicated problems to be shared and solved by people outside the OR community who may not have access to commercial solvers. OpenSolver has been developed by <a href="http://www.des.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/andrew-mason/">Dr Andrew Mason</a> (University of Auckland) and myself. OpenSolver is being used to solve business problems around the world, as well as an educational tool for teaching students about optimization.</p>
